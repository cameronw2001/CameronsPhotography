		<body>Photography is one of my favourite hobbies as I like to capture moments in high resolution, and show them artistically to others or for others. Taking photos can seem really easy to some people but that is because most people pull out their phones and snap pictures that way. That is effective but only to an extent (nowadays with high quality phone cameras). I like to go out or bring my camera with me everywhere I go just in case I run into a good spot to take some serious photos, that I think would end up looking really good. With the focus, artistic skills, and my photography skills, I have come up with some photos to display to you guys that are some of my favourites.</body>
